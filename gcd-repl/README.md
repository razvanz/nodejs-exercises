GCD REPL
========

Create a Node.js application which calculates the greatest common divisor of 2 integers read from the stdin and outputs them to stdout.

Hints:

-	[readline](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/readline.html) native module for stdin read / stdout write
-	[gcd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gcd) for calculating the greatest common divisor

Test solution
-------------

```
nodejs-exercises $ node gcd-repl/index.js
Which are the integers?
121 44
GCD is: 11
```
